Welcome to the Rehearsal-Player wiki!

This player, named "Rehearsal Player", aims at helping dancers during their looong hours of rehearsal, by providing a dedicated interface to play part of a media file, again and again, until pain, tireness or boredom comes.

Here are the main things made available:
* chaptering of the media file with direct editing;
* easy launch of play of one or more chapters, with option for repeat with pause and selection of playing speed;
* interface dedicated to easy usage on small-screen netbooks.

This should be enough for rehearsing the same part again and again, without having to go to the computer playing the song again and again.
 
In order to store these chapters, Matroska is planned to be used: chapters are already part of mkv container format, which may contain all common media filetypes. One interesting side-effect is that the media file is still readable by any decent media player.
