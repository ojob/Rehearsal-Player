RehearsalPlayer ReadMe
======================

This player, named "Rehearsal Player", aims at helping dancers during their 
looong hours of rehearsal, by providing a dedicated interface to play part 
of a media file, again and again.

Here are the main things made available:
 - chaptering of the media file with direct editing;
 - easy launch of play of one or more chapters, with option for repeat with
   pause and selection of playing speed;
 - interface dedicated to easy usage on small-screen netbooks.

This should be enough for rehearsing the same part again and again, without
having to go to the computer playing the song again and again.
 
Chapters are already part of mkv container format, which may contain all 
common media filetypes. This player then bring a playing capacity of using
them easily, and an editing capacity of the chapters; one interesting side-
effect is that the media file is still readable by any decent media player.

Features list: see ROADMAP.txt file.
