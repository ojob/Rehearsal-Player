RehearsalPlayer Roadmap
=======================

0.1 - complete GUI prototype 
    No function is planned to work, this is only a matter of positioning
    buttons around, and check capacity of GUI library.

0.2 - basic media play
    Sound media file can be loaded, played, paused, stopped at any time, 
    and played at a defined speed. This step is a matter of checking 
    capacity of media playing library.
    
0.3 - chapters definition
    Chapters may be created, deleted, and stored to a separate file. This
    includes GUI manipulation, and display in a tabular way in the bottom.
    Link to media file may be updated at any time.
    Undo/Redo function implemented, as this is a must-have.
    This version is likely to be sent for first external testing.
    
0.4 - one-file storage
    Usage of Matroska container, to take advantage of the chapter feature
    and have them stored in the same file as the Media file, when still 
    having both usable in any decent player.
   
0.5 - project opening
    Introduction of translation support, storage under SourceForge or equi-
    valent. Usage of a bug database and roadmap support would be good, in 
    order to make the project reachable to anyone who would like to parti-
    cipate in its development.
    
0.6 - features enhancement
    Based on users requests, something like Open recent projects, History, 
    movable toolbars, speed-up repetition, etc.
    
1.0 - first public version
    This version is not planned to introduce any new feature, but as a con-
    solidation of what has been implemented before.
